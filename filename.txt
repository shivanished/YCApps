Driver AI	"Driver AI is the new way to write technical documentation. It helps everyone in an organization write interactive documents to explain millions of lines of code in minutes instead of months.

WHO: We partner with chip manufacturing, enterprise IT, and software product development teams.

WHY: Traditionally, these teams spend millions and wait months (sometimes years) to understand their complex technology infrastructure well enough to build on top of it. 

THE DRIVER DIFFERENCE: Instead, Driver AI is a tool that explains complex codebases in minutes vs. months. This enables teams to rapidly accelerate the technical discovery process and save significant resources. 

HOW IT WORKS: Driver AI works by digesting a codebase, organizing it for analysis, and harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate interactive explanations for executives, product and technology leaders, and developers.

Fogbender	"Fogbender helps B2B companies support customer teams: think Intercom meets Slack's shared channels.

This causes a number of operational and logistical difficulties for both vendors and their customers, resulting in added costs, inefficiencies, and lost opportunities.

With Fogbender, B2B vendors embed a team-to-team messaging widget directly on their customer dashboard, where all users belonging to an account can - with no additional authentication - 1) see a list of currently-open issues 2) participate in conversations with their own team and the vendor, and 3) search all historical discussions."	https://www.ycombinator.com//companies/fogbender	fogbender.com	['Andrei Soroker']

With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!
